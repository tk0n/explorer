# Ark Blockchain Explorer

Ark Explorer version 0.2.0 works in conjunction with the Ark Core API. It uses Redis for caching data and Freegeoip to parse IP geo-location data.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ArkEcosystem/Ark-explorer.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/ArkEcosystem/Ark-explorer)

## Prerequisites

These programs and resources are required to install and run Ark Explorer

- Nodejs v6.9.2 or higher (<https://nodejs.org/>) -- Nodejs serves as the underlying engine for code execution.

  ```
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
  ```

- Redis (<http://redis.io>) -- Redis is used for caching parsed exchange data.

  `sudo apt-get install -y redis-server`

- Freegeoip (<https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip>) -- Freegeoip is used by the Network Monitor for IP address geo-location.

  ```
  wget https://github.com/fiorix/freegeoip/releases/download/v3.1.5/freegeoip-3.1.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  tar -zxf freegeoip-3.1.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ln -s freegeoip-3.1.5-linux-amd64 freegeoip
  nohup ./freegeoip/freegeoip > ./freegeoip/freegeoip.log 2>&1 &
  ```

- Bower (<http://bower.io/>) -- Bower helps to install required JavaScript dependencies.

  `sudo npm install -g bower`

- Grunt.js (<http://gruntjs.com/>) -- Grunt is used to compile the frontend code and serves other functions.

  `sudo npm install -g grunt`

- Forever (<https://github.com/foreverjs/forever>) -- Forever manages the node processes for Ark Explorer

  `sudo npm install -g forever`

- Git (<https://github.com/git/git>) -- Used for cloning and updating Ark Explorer

  `sudo apt-get install -y git`

- Tool chain components -- Used for compiling dependencies

  `sudo apt-get install -y python build-essential automake autoconf libtool`

## Installation Steps

Clone the Ark Explorer Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-explorer.git
cd ark-explorer
npm install
bower install
```

## Build Steps

#### Frontend
 The frontend must be built with Grunt before starting Ark Explorer. Run the following command to compile the frontend components:

`grunt compile`

#### Market Watcher
 Candlestick data needs to be initialized prior to starting Ark Explorer. During runtime candlestick data is updated automatically.

To build candlestick data for each exchange run:

`grunt candles:build`

To update candlestick data manually run after initialization:

`grunt candles:update`

## Configuration

The default `config.js` file contains all of the configuration settings for Ark Explorer. These options can be modified according to comments included in configuration file.

#### Top Accounts

To enable Top Accounts functionality, start your ark node (not the explorer) using the following command:

```
TOP=true node app.js
```

## Managing Ark Explorer

To test that Ark Explorer is configured correctly, run the following command:

`node app.js`

Open: <http://localhost:6040>, or if its running on a remote system, switch `localhost` for the external IP Address of the machine.

Once the process is verified as running correctly, `CTRL+C` and start the process with `forever`. This will fork the process into the background and automatically recover the process if it fails.

`forever start app.js`

After the process is started its runtime status and log location can be found by issuing this statement:

`forever list`

To stop Explorer after it has been started with `forever`, issue the following command:

`forever stop app.js`

## Tests

Before running any tests, please ensure Ark Explorer and Ark Client are configured to run on the Ark Testnet.

Replace **config.js** with **config.test** file from the **test** directory:

`cp test/config.test ./config.js`

Replace the **config.json** for the Ark Client the corresponding file under the **test** directory:

`cp test/config_Ark.json  /PATH_TO_Ark_DIR/config.json`

Then restart the Ark Client (example):

`bash /PATH_TO_Ark_DIR/Ark.sh reload`

Launch Ark Explorer (runs on port 6040):

`forever start app.js`

Run the test suite:

`npm test`

Run individual tests:

```
npm test -- test/api/accounts.js
npm test -- test/api/transactions.js
```
